# Memory Munchers Rules

# What is expected to be on the team 

- Be on time for meetings
- Communication, and respectful communication
- Everyone will contribute
- Be willing to help eachother instead of having a "not my problem" mindset. If you have more time than someone who's cramming for 5 exams, maybe you could help them out
- Hold eachother accountable and being accountable to yourself and what your assigned work is
- Work should be devised equally generally
- If you see something going on that you don't like, don't hide it, communicate your concerns with respect

# How to address situations where group "rules" are not being followed

- If there is a small dispute between two people, either try to talk it out with the person. If you don't see any progress on the problem, definitely bring it up to a lead or TA
- For more serious matters, contact the TA or professor
