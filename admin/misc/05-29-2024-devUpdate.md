# 5/29/2024 Team Update

Since our last meeting, our team has finished all of the Github Issues for sprint 1.

## Some of the features we implemented from last week are as follows:

- Search functionality to search for notes in journal
- Adding/deleting tags on notes
- Modified CI/CD pipeline to deploy BOTH our actual app and JSDocs auto generated documentation website
- Sidebar functionality is complete -- notes are displayed per project and grouped by first tag
- We also held the Sprint 1 Review & Retro meeting and planned our Sprint 2

## Artifacts of Sprint 1 progress

As of right now, we have conducted an in-person "pre sprint 2 meeting" and are planning on doing the following, which we have created Github Issues for and assigned to people:

### Sprint 2:

### Done:

- Decompose code so that not everything is in `index.js` but instead grouped by actual functionality

### Planned (planning on finishing by Sunday):

- Finalize CI/CD pipeline to include more unit tests AND create E2E tests with Pupeteer
- Add lab 8 concepts (service worker and PWA) concepts to project to ensure our app is local first
- UI team will overhaul the UI of our app so that we have different colors (team was unsure about current color pallete), buttons have CSS, allignment bugs fixed, and any other design changes the UI team deems necessarry
- Implement export/import project from localStorage data
- Implement delete project
- Implement better markdown templates to choose from (they are just a title right now)
- Add better JSDocs function comments to make code more readable
