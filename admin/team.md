- Christopher Schrader:
    I'm a 3rd year Computer Science major interested in web development and am a co-leader for the team. Some things about me are that I'm 22 years old, have a dog Jenna that I really love,
    and like to play FPS games like Counter-Strike and Overwatch.

    Most of my repositories for my projects are private, but my github profile can be found [here](https://github.com/chris-529)
