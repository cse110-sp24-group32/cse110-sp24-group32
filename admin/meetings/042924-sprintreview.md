- **Figma Team:** Arjun K, Arjun V, Hailani
    - Members Notes:
      - Took inspirations from other apps.
      - Found Figma challenging as they had never used it before.
      - Wished they had discussed features more as a group.
      - Complexity arose despite intentions to keep it simple.
      - Acknowledged the need for better communication with other teams.
      - Found color scheme creation challenging but ultimately successful.
      - Initially aimed for separate mobile and desktop versions but realized they could make it responsive.
  
  - **CSS/HTML Team:** Anthony, Chris, (1/2 David)
    - Static design:
      - Initially planned 3 sections but reduced to 2 due to concerns about finishing on time.
      - Found creating the checklist at the top challenging.
      - Identified CSS as messy and suggested better commenting for future projects.
    - Task layout and creating a new task:
      - Added deadlines.
      - Faced difficulties in figuring out where to modify JavaScript code.
      - Each task took 1-2 hours.

  - **JavaScript Team:** Thanh, Thomas, Philip, (2/2 David) 
    
      - Implemented local storage and utilized a nice API for JavaScript.
      - Used local storage, classes, and HTML elements.
      - Required extensive googling.
      - Completed in roughly 2 hours.
      - Encountered merge conflicts due to local storage implementation and sought ways to avoid them.
      - Noted a challenge in creating functions affecting only specific elements without impacting others.
      - Each task took 1-2 hours due to limited JavaScript knowledge.
      - Conflicts with merging branches arose from implementing task addition using localStorage versus without. Improved communication and planning could have prevented this.

  - **Video Production Team:** Richard
    
      - Produced a video.
