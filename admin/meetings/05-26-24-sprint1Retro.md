- Same as sprint review attendance

## For our retrospective meeting we used Retrium and utilized the "mad, sad, glad" retrospective they offer.

## Decisions:

- We agreed to have subteams communicate more before work begins to ensure everyone understands their assigned task
- Agreed on things for sprint 2: Improved CI/CD pipeline (linter changes and more unit tests, possibly E2E testing with Pupeteer), bug fixes, design changes
- Agreed to clean up code before sprint 2 by separating JS code into multiple files
