# Adding notes / Manager



# Sidebar
Chris, David - for the sidebar, we can now create new projects, and when we make new notes, they are automatically grouped by their tags. Implemented a new project function, a render sidebar function-populates all created projects. We can reload the page and the notes are saved in localstorage, we can add and remove tags and the note would automatcically get regrouped by their first tag. 


# Search bar
Philip,Anthony, Richard  - Friday, we made the search function using the manager instance and an eventlistener, and find the content and tags matching the query. All of the matching notes would be populated in the pop up bar and when you would click on a note then the main page would open up that note. 
Arjun - Added some header css and html by adding the logo and a button to the chat assistant page. Added the export functionality which allows user to save a particular note as a json file.
