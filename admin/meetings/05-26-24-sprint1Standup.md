# Adding notes / Manager

Thomas showed off the backend Manager class he worked on over the weekend to get the team onboarded with the backend classes

Manager class – storing persistent data of projects and notes
Save function takes from Manager and stores in local storage -> call save and it will save
Proxy – is an important function – every time we try to set property -> it will automatically save
Everything (nodes & projects) is added to proxy
The manager also manages markdown (a little UI managing), but mostly nodes & projects managing
If manually edit a property with =, it will save
