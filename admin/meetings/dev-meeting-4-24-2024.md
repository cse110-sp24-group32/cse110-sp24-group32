# What our team has done so far week 3

  - Team meeting on Monday
  - Used Miro to brainstorm design and functionality of task list
  - Agreed on doing the task list widget
  - Assigned work during meeting
  - Created Github Project with issues and added specs to each task
  - Finalized design for mobile and desktop look using Figma
  - Began HTML structure of task list widget
  - Began CSS of task list widget

  # To do for the rest of week 3

  - Finalize static HTML/CSS version of the task list
  - Implement JS functionality
  - Create video
  - BWOT analysis

# Retrospective thoughts on warmup

- Maybe shouldn't have done separate mobile and web design, should've focused on one singular design we can make responsive
- More conclusive designing could've been done during the meeting, maybe we can do the rough marker sketch prof. mentioned for general page layout in future meetings for the project
