## For our retrospective meeting we used Retrium and utilized the "mad, sad, glad" retrospective they offer.

# High points (most voted on items):

## Mad: 

- Nobody was mad about anything, just listed "mads" in sad pretty much.

## Sad:

- Something I was sad about was the slight communication gap between the design and dev teams as a result of which we couldn't discuss the feasibility of the design. It was good to talk about it with others during sprint review
- There could have been more collaboration between teams.
- we didnt have a concrete list of features/behavioral items for the app, for main project need to decide on this earlier

## Glad:

- It was exciting to use figma for the first time and learn how design plays a role in the entire webdev process. Also understood the value of communication. The sprint review helped bring all this to light
- Team leads are responsive and try to connect the team :)
- We got all the features to work on time

## Decisions:

- We agreed on having a "master document" for our main project where we pretty much list all of the features we've agreed on and what the app is supposed to be
- We agreed to restructure the teams into something more practical rather than HTML/CSS and JS and design. Most likely going to go with design, front end, back end, and have design work with front end very closely. Back end will be a smaller sized team most likely.
- Add another meeting to the week rather than just 1
- Have a meeting at 2:15-2:45 PM on coming up with brainstorm ideas for the work journal app, potentially a weekly Friday meeting at this time
- For every github issue, it will have a branch and they should merge from the main before starting their work and send a pull request
- For each issue -> Make own branch for specific issue -> Make sure that branch is up to date with main branch -> those branches make sure is up to date with main
- Have 1 person on the team that is always communicating with 1 person from another team
