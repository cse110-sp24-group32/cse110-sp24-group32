# Backend ADR

Context and Problem Statement

In the context of needing to be able to create, read, update, and delete developer markdown notes in our app, we needed to figure out a backend that could handle this. PLUS, it needs to be able to save it locally via local storage so that a user can have persisting data. We also need the backend to not be too complex for the front end team to use, abstracting the difficulty of it away from interacting with it.

# Considered Options

- Singleton design pattern
- Adapter design pattern
- Module design pattern

We decided that the Singleton Design Pattern did not make any sense in our case because we are building a program from scratch and do not need to build a bridge/adapter between an already predefined interface.

We also decided not to use the Module Design Pattern because we conducted research that told us it would be hard to compose different objects using this method, which is what we needed in our program.

Ultimately, the Facade Design Pattern made the most sense for us since we have a large (11) development team that will benefit from the “facade” of an interface class, abstracting all of the unnecessary complications of the backend into interactable methods for the front end to hook up to.

# Decision Outcome

We decided to go with the Singleton Design Pattern with a Manager class/object that acts as a single back-end interface object and state-manager, utilizing composed Note and Project objects in various back-end CRUD methods/class functions.

We also serialize the Manager object for our app into JSON and save it locally with localStorage.

# Class documentation

# Note class:

## Constructor:
```
constructor(p, c, t, l)
Where
p = project associated with note
c = note markdown content
t = note title
l = list of tags
```

## Attributes:
```
This.proj = Project object note is attached to
This.content = Raw MD of note
This.title = Title of note
This.id = UUID of note
```

# Manager class:

## Non-serialized Properties:

```
this.data : The data (properties) of Manager that we serialize to and parse from localStorage
this.mdTarget : a Markdown renderer object which is initialized and passed in the constructor
```

## Serialized Properties:

```
this.notes = data.notes (all Note objects in the app)
this.projs = data.projs (all Project objects in the app)
this.curNoteId = data.curNoteId (Id of Note object app is focused on)
this.curProjId = data.curProjId (Id of Project object app is focused on)
```

## Methods:

## Constructor:
`constructor(mdTarget) `

## Create methods:
``
addProj(name)
addNote(note)
``

## Read methods:
```
getNote(id)
getAllNotes()
getAllProjs()
```

## Update methods:
```
changeNote(id)
changeProj(id)
```

## Delete methods:
```
delNote(id)
```

## Helper methods:
```
renderNote()
renderProject()
save() 
```

# Project class:

## Constructor:
```
constructor(name)
Where
name = name of project to make
```

## Attributes:
```
this.name: Name of project
this.id: UUID of project
```
